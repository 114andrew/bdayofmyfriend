            <h3>Happy Birthday, My Best Friend ANKITA🥰</h3>
            <div class="content-scroll">

                <p style="text-align: justify;"> First I saw her with some seniors, the day when some seniors came to
                    our class to announce some messages about our freshers party!
                    The day i felt that "yes may be she's different from others.." because of her calm behaviour and she
                    kept quiet, while in other side all the seniors were busy in making rules, regulations and all ..
                    but she was quite different.. Her smily face and kind behaviour with everyone made my day 🥰
                    That day I thought that she's the girl who has 0 level of attitude and pure kind heart❤️😊.
                    The way how actually a person needs to be treated, she knows it better ..☺️
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I got to know her name by some sources....
                    That the another name for kindness, politeness is "ANKITA" 😊
                    after some days she started talking with me,
                    I still remember that first in Lab she asked me about a ma'am that "which subject she teaches to you".
                    the same day i was moving down with stairs at the corner she called me with my name and asked my
                    insta I'd, i was surprised... that i saw many girls with huge level of attitude but she's the one
                    who still don't even know completely about me and she came to ask my insta I'd, on that day i
                    realised that she's a little girl who don't know how the society is! And i decided to take care of
                    her and teach her how not be in this cruel society,,.. how people usually take use of kind ones!
                    And i saw her some cute phases 🥰 which usually started to made my days 😄
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And we both started texting each other, she told me some interesting but dangerous desires of her
                    one of it is to break the bear bottle infront of police and run away 😂 and she said many cringe
                    desires of her which are very fun maker but dangerous 😄.
                    after some days i got super close to her ... and she taught me, how to be happy and how to enjoy in
                    every situation😊.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And after some days she passed some very critical
                    phases ... which she was not interested to share with anyone... but I forced her to explain those to
                    me, she said no many times but again she was texting me that " bass tu math chodke jaana 🥺"
                    I felt very bad for her that some people hurted her... so i never let it to hide it from me ... and
                    she told completely about her sad past in call.. may be she thaught I'll also leave her by listening
                    them... but i came to stay there with her not to move ..!
                    I felt very guilt that how could anyone hurt her, as she's the most calm and cute little girl. Who
                    taught me how to live in my bad phases but may be she forgot to apply those in her own life...
                    And i supported her , never let her down.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Aur ha agar gussa, ya pareshaniya aye tho khamosh hojati hai😔.. kisiko batati nahi
                    Mujhe bass uski khamoshi se dar lagta hai..🥺
                    Chocolates pasand hai usse 😍
                    I still remembered once she asked me for a chocolate just in the name of bet and i was very scared
                    because of her cringe classmates and teachers as what they think... and made some confidence and
                    gave her that dairy milk 😄.
                    And after she also took care of me very much in my worst days ☺️❤️
                    And i was very upset that i was unable to take her out to enjoy, later some days our bonding became
                    very strong and i found that she's in way of finding best friend who could stay with her forever and
                    not only for their benefit. i decided to stay with her untill my last breath, and now she's the one
                    for my happiness,my breath, my heart , and my everything 🥺🌍
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And i love her very much being her best friend, she taught me many things in life 😊
                    And finally some time we went outside to gossip in cafe where we eat momos😊. but the day was not
                    much satisfied that her parents called her so... she moved quickly.
                    And finally she got passed out of her graduation life ... and we missed those daily hookups and
                    started talking only in calls and chats. And got to know that my princess was working very hard for
                    her family day and night, restlessly 🥺 ... some days even I missed her very much and waited for
                    her messages 🥺 but understood that my princess is very struggling hard..
                    So i felt bad for her that she's very soft but experiencing very hard...🥺
                    And i felt she need to be cared more🫶, she became more important in my life then my own soul,
                    I'm always there for you my princess 😍 and to be prompt when you talk with other boys i feel very
                    jealous 😄 and feel That you're only mine 🥺❤️ and you're not suppose to talk with other boys 😄.
                    But that's common in friendship and it's my problem 😂 to think like that.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And sorry for the miss behaviours whenever i did, 🥺 i also feel very bad that I can't treat you
                    more better at my peak 😔 and sorry for every Little mistakes i did .
                    Sometimes you may feel that I'm over possesive but yaar when i care, it was really deep down from my
                    heart 🥺.
                    And i feel very special when you ask me for help 😍 and share every Little thing wid me , really i
                    feel like blessed 🙈.
                    You know, i hate waiting 😅..
                    Even my mom dad scolds me for that they say "you need to wait sometime." and i don't wait for
                    anyone.. coz i need quick everything i want, but i can wait throughout of my life only for you 🥰😍.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I feel feared when u say something about your marriage 🥺.. and i pray to god that give her best
                    care taker husband, to handle all her childishness 🥺, and who actually care for her❤️ more than me!
                    :..)
                    And yes some bestfriend converts into couple and sometimes may you also fear and think that i'm also that kind of guy, but be fearless my princess by the way because of your some family restrictions we can't even think of our future together, if it was possible then i really struggled hard for you and gave you everything whatever you just spell it out 😊.... , and i can cross my limits and everything
                    for you but for your safety I can't even think of our living together, and it'll be completely wrong to force someone, many caste obstacles will come inbetween us and that's even not possible to think,
                    So I'm lucky that atleast i got you as my bestest friend Ever 🤗💙.
                    And it's better to go with possible facts. and yes our friendship is more awesome than just lovers🥰.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I hope you'll find a great hand in your future to take care of you more than me, i pray for it 😘 and i know he'll be more luckiest, 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But believe me my princess i love you very much... in all other universes 😍😘🥰✨ I'm there with you
                    whenever you need me untill my last breath ✨🌍😇
                    <br>
                    And now that phrase used above "another name for kindness, politeness is "ANKITA" "
                    Is replaced with 
                    <br>
                    "another name for my happiness, life & everything is you🥰."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    May many people fell for body and upper appearance but i fell for your heart and soul 🥺.

                    The way how you made me smile in my worst times, even if i think of it ,it still makes me smile
                    aur ha kabhi kabhi bahoth pareshan karta hu na mai😣, sorry yaar mai bass apno ko kisi aur ka hote nai dek sakta😢,
                    haa bahoth baar jhagda kia aur gussa hua lekin baadme mai maan bhi gaya hu😅, haa aur mujhe samjne ke liye bahoth bahoth shukriya 🤗, mere ho bass tum mere😍😘.
                    😊Subha ke good morning aam 🥰, se lekar raat ke good night aur take care🥰 tak khayal rakhne ke liye bahot bahoth
                    shukriya ❤️ 🥺 shayad mere liye words hi nai hai tujhe thanks bolne ke liye 🥺 meri jaan.
                    Some friends left me in recent months but you stood by my side and supported me. It was the reason   that i still kept hope in friendship 🥺🫂.
                    You know the difference between superhero and super villain?
                    A Superhero is ready to kill someone to save the people over the planet.
                    But a Super villain is ready to kill everyone just to save his loved ones😊.
                    And yes i can proudly say that I can be super villain to everyone for you 😊.
                    And you taught me best meaning of love that is - "Choosing defeat in every challenge, all because of
                    you is love 🫶🥺."
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    You earned me princess 😘🌍😇
                    And yes it's you're special day ☺️❤️
                    <br>
                    So i hope it's my first wish 😁
                    <br>
